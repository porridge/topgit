# tg2quilt.mk - TopGit-to-quilt functionality for debian/rules files
#
# This make(1) snippet facilitates the conversion of TopGit branches to
# a quilt series.
#
# It is intended to be included from debian/rules files of TopGit-using
# packages after including the quilt rules, like so:
#
#   include /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make
#   -include /usr/share/topgit/tg2quilt.mk
#
# The leading dash is necessary for make not to die when the file is not
# installed. TopGit is not a build dependency (and does not need to be), and
# if the package is not installed, debian/rules can still be used normally.
#
# The snippet exports the following targets. These targets only perform the
# describe behaviour when invoked from a TopGit repository (`tg summary -t`
# returns a non-empty set); used outside, they simply output informational
# messages but do not cause errors.
#
#       tg-export: exports the TopGit patches into a quilt series under
#                  debian/patches.
#                    You may set TG_BRANCHES to a comma- or -space-separated
#                  subset of branches (but not comma-and-space-separated) to
#                  export (before including the file).
#                    If debian/patches/series already exists, the target
#                  will take note, blather a bit, and get out of the way.
#
#        tg-clean: cleans the source tree, just like the debian/rules clean
#                  target, and invokes tg-rmdir
#
#        tg-rmdir: tries to remove debian/patches, but only if there are no
#                  non-TopGit files under the directory.
#                    The heuristic is to find files that do not contain a line
#                  matchines /^tg:/, minus the series file. If any such files
#                  are found, an error occurs. Otherwise, the directory is
#                  removed. This means that edits to the series file are
#                  likely to vanish.
#
#  tg-cleanexport: recreates the debian/patches directory from scratch, using
#                  tg-rmdir and tg-export.
#
#   tg-forceclean: cleans the source tree, just like the debian/rules clean
#                  target, and forcefully removes the debian/patches
#                  directory in doing so. Yes, *force*-fully. WHAM!
#
# This file also hooks into the standard debian/rules and quilt targets such
# that tg-export is automatically invoked before quilt gets a chance to patch
# or unpatch the tree.
#
# The QUILT_PATCH_DIR variable can be set before including the file to override
# the default debian/patches location.
#
# More information, particularly for people working on TopGit-using packages,
# can be found in /usr/share/doc/topgit/HOWTO-tg2quilt.gz .
