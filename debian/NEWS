topgit (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Debian topgit package now provides a Makefile snippet for inclusion from
  debian/rules, to facilitate the creation of a quilt series from TopGit
  branches during the package build (and cleanup) step. Please refer to
  /usr/share/doc/topgit/HOWTO-tg2quilt.gz and /usr/share/topgit/tg2quilt.mk
  for more information. You can see it in action in the topgit package itself.

  To stop the proliferation of TopGit boilerplate, which could make later
  maintenance and changes more difficult, you are encouraged to make use of
  the snippet.

  If you have ideas for other features, I'd be happy to incorporate them.
  Patches most welcome.
